							   <P align="left"></P>I was born in Madrid (Spain) in 1989, I have always been passionate about 
							   <b>technology</b>, but it wasn't until I needed it that I started to investigate 
							   what it was all about. After a long period working in front of the public, 
							   I decided to take a break and moved 
							   to Brighton (UK), where I perfected some personal skills that I now consider fundamental: 
							   languages, communication, self-sufficiency...<br>
							   I then moved back to Spain, where I started working in a financial services company 
							   for 7 years, where, after completing a <b>master's degree in financial management and business control</b>, 
							   I was promoted several times until I became <b>Operations Manager</b> of 
							   the Spanish subsidiary, in charge of a large commercial team and with huge responsibilities.
							   It was here that I understood the great power of data and the need for good analysis.<br> 
							   At the beginning of the pandemic, and with a lot of free time, I decided to study a <b>master's 
								   degree in Data Science</b>, where I discovered that everything I was looking for existed... 
							   and much more! 
							   After finishing my training, I stayed on campus where I studied, working as a 
							   <b>Teacher Assistant</b> in the Data Science module.
							   Now I am working as a <b>Data Analyst</b> in the most important airline in Spain, 
							   where I am starting to apply some of the knowledge I have gained, but this is just the 
							   beginning.<br> My medium-term goal is to master data analysis tools to perfection, and together 
							   with my experience as an operations manager, complete an <b>interesting profile</b> that can help 
							   companies in a technical way, as well as from a business point of view.
